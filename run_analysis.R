### Step 0 - read in data  
# 
#### initial read is given a suffix of 0
#### suffix is incremented by 1 for each transformation 
##
#### From the original README.txt 
####
##### Forr each record it is provided:
##### Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
##### Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
##### A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
##### Its activity label. 
##### An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

#### From the original features_info.txt
#####               
##### t prefix denotes time domain signals, except for these that are averages
#####      tBodyAccMean
#####      tBodyAccJerkMean
#####      tBodyGyroMean
#####      tBodyGyroJerkMean
##### f prefix denotes frequency domain signals
##### anything else was estimated from signal

### Step 1 - Merge training and test sets                         #
##########################################################################

####combine rows
####new file starts again with suffix of 0
x0 <- rbind(x_test2, x_train2) # 10299 rows

####save 
save(x0, file = "x0.Rda")

### Step 2 - Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation     #
#                             for each measurement.                      #
# mean, std
##########################################################################

# err on the side of including too many variables
# unable to combine in a single step... matches seemed to override exclusions

# take any fields containing any case of "mean" or "std"

### Step 3 - Use descriptive activity names on activities in the data set         #
##########################################################################

# add activity label to left side
# leaving in the activity_cd on purpose

# clean up environment
rm(mean_std0, mean_std1, mean_std2)

##########################################################################
### Step 4 - Label the data set with descriptive variable names                   #
##########################################################################

# save current column names
mean_std3_colNames0 <- as.data.frame(colnames(mean_std3))

# remove the _### required for uniqueness
# this should be done in one step using regex...

        mutate(activity = str_sub(activity, end = -5  )) 

# fix the 3 without _#### that got wrecked...

mean_std3_colNames1[2,1] = "activity"
mean_std3_colNames1[3,1] = "subject"

# replace the column names
colnames(mean_std3) <-  mean_std3_colNames1$activity

# check column names are still unique
count(names(mean_std3))


####save so you can start over...
setwd("..")

#load (mean_std3.Rda")

# clean up environment

### Step 5 -  create an independent tidy data set with the                         #
### average of each variable for each activity and each subject.           #
