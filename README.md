###General plan
- read comments in  run_analysis.R as you go
- intitial files read in with with original names + 0
- files names suffix incremented by 1 for each major change
- new files named as explicitly as possible
- original field names kept as intact as possible 
- final file wrote out with a "|" so that anyone with a text editor can tell the fields apart

### Codebook
- extracts from original data's README, features_info.txt plus my comments

###Code to read in table:  
-temp <-read.table("tidy_narrow.txt", sep = "|")
